# Node-challenge-4
Just Clone or Download the project, then if you have mongodb installed on your pc you'll just create a database named "form", then you create a collection inside it and name the collection "students". When you're done just open your terminal and browse to the folder that contains your project, run "nodemon" then you should see something like this:
"Server has started on port:8080
 Connected to MongoDB" if not this you will get an error message, and if you get an error don't panick just look for the following line:
"throw er; // Unhandled 'error' event"
and read the first line under it, then you will understand what you will need to fix.
You fix it up until it gives you "Server has started on port:8080, Connected to MongoDB. Then you are safe to run "localhost:8080" on your browser and you should see the home page of this project, then you click on "Add Students" to add info on the database.
# Goodluck **:)**
